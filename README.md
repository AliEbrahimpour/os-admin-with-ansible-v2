### About the Book
This book is intended for Cloud Operators and/or Infrastructure administrators who are adopting an OpenStack cloud and want to automate administrative functions using Ansible. The book can provide a two-for-one type of learning experience. We will start with a brief overview of OpenStack and Ansible, highlighting some best practices.  Next, the beginning of each following chapter will allow you to become more familiar with how to handle Cloud Operator administration tasks such as creating multiple users/tenants, managing containers, customizing your clouds quotas, taking instance snapshots, setting up active-active regions, running cloud health checks and more.  Finally, each chapter will conclude with a step-by-step tutorial on how to automate those tasks with Ansible.  As an added bonus, the fully functional Ansible code can be found here in this GitHub repository.
